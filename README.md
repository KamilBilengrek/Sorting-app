# Sorting app

## Overview

Hello!  
My program can be used to sort number arrays that consists of integers.  
I made this project to test my GUI skills and my python programming in general. I was focusing on making the cleanest possible code while trying my best to make sure program will work as indented.  
In future I may write a OOP based version of app but it may take some time before it happens.

### How to use program

1. Download ZIP
2. Extract
3. Run **main.py**

## My process

### Built with

* Python3
* Python3 libraries:
    * tkinter
    * messagebox
    * random

### Continued development

I'm planning on adding more sorting methods to the program to enhance my algorithmic knowledge and problem solving skills.  
I am also going to add possibility to input floating point numbers to the array.
